                    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was both my introduction to the legend of Zelda series and
                    the first Nintendo switch game I played so it has a large place in my heart so I will try not to be
                    biased. Well actually no I wont it's my own review. In breath of the wild you play as Link, a
                    swordsman who was put into a regenerative coma for 100 years. You fight both physically and mentally
                    to regain your memories and save your princess. The core theme of botw is adventure, you are
                    constantly incentivised to go explore. I loved this, I am a huge fan of non linear games as they can
                    be some of the most rewarding games. Found a weird tree? go climb it and look at that you are
                    rewarded with a korok seed! A more personal enjoyment of mine was Link rekindling his old
                    friendships, as mentioned before this game takes place 100 years after a big event that devestated
                    Hyrule and this included the "deaths" of his friends (I put it in quotes cause it's technically not
                    death because it's a game children can play but they pretty much died) and each of those character
                    s have their own scene with Link and it's so heartwrenching and the worst of it is there is a scene
                    you get at the end of the DLC where they all take a picture together and you get a printed copy of
                    that picture when you buy the digital art book which ofc I did. Anyway! Breath of the wild is an
                    amazing game which is a very good entryway into the legend of zelda series that I highly recommend.
