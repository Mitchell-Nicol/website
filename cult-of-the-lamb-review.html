    <h1>My Cult of the Lamb Review:</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>Cult of the Lamb is a very cute and fun cult building/dungeon crawler game
            where you play as a the last lamb about to be slaughtered by "the old gods"
            when you are saved and empowered by "the one who waits". You are then tasked
            with building up a cult to kill all "the old gods" in the name of "the one who
            waits" and free them from their prison. I have played this game
            <strong>religiously</strong> (har har) and I have to say it is up there as my
            favourite game. The dev team clearly love to make this game and it's
            DLC's it's such a passionate project and it really shows. The style is very
            unique and cute, the characters are well written, the lore is deep and, of course
            most importantly, the lamb is adorable. I have talked ebnough about what I love
            about the game but ofcourse there are some things that rub me the wrong way.
            Firstly there are some decisions you can make that are irreverable and they do
            <strong>not</strong> make it clear. Even worse some of the achievements requir
            you to make these irreverable decisions. I also don't particularly enjoy the
            combat part of the game (which is like 50% of the game) but this is purely 
            personal and the combat itself is actually really well done.</p>
