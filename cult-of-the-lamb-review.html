                    Cult of the Lamb is a very cute and fun cult building/dungeon crawler game where you play as a the
                    last lamb about to be slaughtered by "the old gods" when you are saved and empowered by "the one who
                    waits". You are then tasked with building up a cult to kill all "the old gods" in the name of "the
                    one who waits" and free them from their prison. I have played this game
                    <strong>religiously</strong> (har har) and I have to say it is up there as my favourite game. The
                    dev team clearly love to make this game and it's DLC's. It's such a passionate project and it really
                    shows. The style is very unique and cute, the characters are well written, the lore is deep and, of
                    course most importantly, the lamb is adorable. I have talked enough about what I love about the
                    game but ofcourse there are some things that rub me the wrong way. Firstly there are some decisions
                    you can make that are irreversable and they do <strong>not</strong> make it clear. Even worse some of
                    the achievements require you to make these irreversable decisions. I also don't particularly enjoy the
                    combat part of the game (which is like 50% of the game) but this is purely personal and the combat
                    itself is actually really well done.
