                Hello! I am Mitchell, I am a game dev student and this website is a test to see my HTML skills. Here I
                will post reviews on games I enjoy, as of making the website there should be 3 reviews. I hope to add to
                this more in my personal time! :] p.s. you may see some stuff and be like "why is that here? Seems
                pointless" I get you! It is probably there so fulfill a requirement for an assessment o7

                So anyway you came here to know about me! As I said before I am a game dev student but one of my other
                passions is creative writting! I like to read, mostly fantasy, and ofcourse play video games. I try to
                do a good amount of physical activity aswell such as walking, and skating.
