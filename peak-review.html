        <h1>My Peak Review:</h1>
        <p>Peak on the surface is a fun climbing game about working together with your
            friends to reach the peak of a very treacherous mountain. It might start
            this way, you might be having fun, helping your buddies climb by standing
            above them and offering a hand, feeding them when they are hungry and overall
            helping them out. It will not stay that way. Soon enough your friends will
            stop respecting that you <strong>need</strong> to bring Bing Bong with you.
            They will stop waiting up to help you up when you are low on stamina.
            They will feed you poisonous mushroom and they <strong>WILL</strong> eat you
            the moment your goofy little character turns into a big walking cooked
            rotisserie chicken!</p>
        <p>*Ahem* Anyway, peak is a fun multiplayer game about climbing. It has a bunch
            of different gadgets like rope spools, canons, pitons, ballon and chain guns
            to help you and your friends climb. It aslo has a hunger and stamina system
            so you have to take care of yourself and make sure you have enough energy to
            make the climb and don't forget if you hurt yourself you're going to find it
            harder to climb. With perseverence and teamwork you will be able to reach the
            peak. The game is a masterclass in social game development, with the right mix
            of helpful ways friends can assist eachother and funny way friends can mess
            with eachother. I have played peak a bunch mainly with 2 friends and it has
            been a blast. I would highly recommend anyone with a friend group who enjoys
            working together and screwing eachother over to try it it!</p>
